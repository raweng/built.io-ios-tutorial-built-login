/** A BuiltACL is used to control which users can access or modify a particular object. Each BuiltObject can have its own BuiltACL. You can grant read and write permissions separately to specific users, to groups of users that belong to roles, or you can grant permissions to “the public” so that, for example, any user could read a particular object but only a particular set of users could write to that object. */
